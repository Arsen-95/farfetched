# v0.9

### Do not use `externalCache` adapter

`externalCache` adapter was deprecated in [0.8](/releases/0-8), write your own adapter instead [by recipe](/recipes/server_cache).

### Read-only [_Stores_](https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/store) and [_Events_](https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/event)

[_Events_](https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/event) `finished.*` have never been supposed to be called in application code. Now they are read-only. In case you call them, you will get a warning in console in Effector 22 and exception in Effector 23.

[_Stores_](https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/store) `$data`, `$error`, `$status`, `$idle`, `$pending`, `$succeeded`, `$failed`, `$enabled` have never been supposed to be changed in application code directly. Now they are read-only. In case you change them, you will get a warning in console in Effector 22 and exception in Effector 23.
