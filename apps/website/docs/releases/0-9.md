# v0.9

## Migration guide

Since v0.9 is technical release with no new significant features, there are a few breaking changes that you should be aware of.

### Do not use `externalCache` adapter

`externalCache` adapter was deprecated in [0.8](/releases/0-8), write your own adapter instead [by recipe](/recipes/server_cache).

### Read-only [_Stores_](https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/store) and [_Events_](https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/event)

[_Events_](https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/event) `finished.*` have never been supposed to be called in application code. Now they are read-only. In case you call them, you will get a warning in console in Effector 22 and exception in Effector 23.

[_Stores_](https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/store) `$data`, `$error`, `$status`, `$idle`, `$pending`, `$succeeded`, `$failed`, `$enabled` have never been supposed to be changed in application code directly. Now they are read-only. In case you change them, you will get a warning in console in Effector 22 and exception in Effector 23.

### Separate [_Event_](https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/event) for [_Query_](/api/primitives/query) cancelation

Cancelled [_Queries_](/api/primitives/query) were treated as failed before this release. We have added a separate [_Event_](https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/event) `.aborted` to [_Query_](/api/primitives/query) to distinguish between cancelation and failure. It is recommended to use `.aborted` instead of `.finished.failure` to handle cancelation. In the next release v0.10 cancelation will not be treated as failure anymore, so you will have to handle it explicitly.
