# Testing

We believe that the only way to write good code is to test it. It leads to the following consequences:

1. Any Farfetched feature is creating with testing in mind, so users do not have to invent some complex ways to test their code.
2. Farfetched is tested itself. It means that you can be sure that it works as expected. We are not accepting any pull requests that do not have tests.
